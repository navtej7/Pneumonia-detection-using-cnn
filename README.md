Pneumonia detection using cnn on kaggle dataset of chest x-ray.

Pneumonia is a form of an acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.
In this project, main objective is to properly detect patients having pneumonia with a good accuracy.
So, a model consisting of layered neural networks was built. After that model was trained using the datasets and using this trained model pneumonia was detected from samples with the help of classification. 
The principles of feature extraction were used for the samples. Then a confusion matrix was printed which will correspond to the results obtained through the processing of the model.
The neural network architecture was specifically designed for pneumonia image classification tasks. The proposed technique is based on the convolutional neural network algorithm, utilizing a set of neurons to convolve on a given image and extract relevant features from them.
